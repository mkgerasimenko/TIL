### Today I Learned

Every day we unconsciously learn something new. The technical area - is a very big platform with knowledge. 
We can find out about the *"How to pull docker image"/"How to create azure-pipeline"/"How to change language in our PC"/etc* - but, we rarely save those notes to file. 

Saving any pieces of knowledge into `GitHub` - **good practice!**

**Benefits:**
 - Usability 
 - User-friendly interface
 - Online repository
 - A scalable solution
